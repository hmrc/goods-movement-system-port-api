      description: "Retrieves summary details for each GMR that has been checked-in to depart from the port with the `portId` provided, and has not yet embarked.  The details returned include flags to indicate whether an inspection is required and whether the GMR is ready to embark.\n\nMore specifically, this returns GMRs whose state is `CHECKED_IN` where the `portId` for the `routeId` given in `checkedInCrossing` matches the `portId` provided.\n\nThe number of results is limited to 7000 GMRs.  If this limit is exceeded a `400 Bad Request` will be returned with the `TOO_MANY_RESULTS` error code.  \n\nThe results list can be filtered using the `lastUpdatedFrom` and `lastUpdatedTo` query parameters. \n\nThe results are sorted by `updatedDateTime`, most recent first.\n\nWe recommend the calling application calls this endpoint no more than once per minute per port to stay within API rate limits.\n\nThe calling application must be subscribed with the `portId` provided else a `403 Forbidden` will be returned.\n"
