      summary: Get controlled GMRs at arrival port
      description: |
        Retrieves summary details for each GMR that requires inspection and is arriving at the port with the `portId` provided.

        More specifically, this returns GMRs whose state is `EMBARKED`, that have `inspectionRequired` set to true, and where the `portId` for the `routeId` given in `actualCrossing` matches the `portId` provided.

        We recommend the calling application calls this endpoint no more than once per minute per port to stay within API rate limits.

        The calling application must be subscribed with the `portId` provided else a `403 Forbidden` will be returned.

        More specifically, this returns GMRs whose state is `CHECKED_IN` where the `portId` for the `routeId` given in `checkedInCrossing` matches the `portId` provided.

        The number of results is limited to 7000 GMRs. If this limit is exceeded a 400 Bad Request will be returned with the TOO_MANY_RESULTS error code.

        The results list can be filtered using the `lastUpdatedFrom` and `lastUpdatedTo` query parameters.

        The results are sorted by `updatedDateTime`, most recent first.

      description: |
        This endpoint gets details of all reference data used by GVMS.

        Reference data includes lists of:
        * Carriers operating on GVMS routes
        * Ports operating GVMS routes 
        * GVMS routes (combining a carrier and a pair of ports)
        * Validation rule failure codes and descriptions

        The reference data is returned as a single JSON document containing all required data lists.

        New carriers, routes, ports and locations will be added with effective from and to dates, so your software will have an advance view of upcoming changes.  It should not offer up routes that are not yet in effect or that have expired.

        GVMS reference data is updated periodically. If you are a GVMS API subscriber, you will receive notifications about upcoming updates. If you receive a notification about an update, your application software must refresh the reference data by calling the GET reference-data endpoint.
