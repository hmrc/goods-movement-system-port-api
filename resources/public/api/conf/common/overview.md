This API provides resources from the Goods Vehicle Movement Service (GVMS) for ports and border locations.

GVMS is used by hauliers to declare all goods movements crossing certain UK roll-on-roll-off ports.

This API is used by ports and border locations to:

* get a list of controlled GMR details that have embarked to or arrived at a GVMS port or border location
* get a list of controlled GMR details that are checked-in for departure at a GVMS port or border location
* get GVMS reference data 


For more details, see the **GVMS Service Guide for Carriers and Border Locations** document issued to you when registering with HMRC.
